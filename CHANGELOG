# CHANGELOG

## Version 0.3.1 (2026-01-28)

- Enabled blackbody planet spectrum for eclipse geometry.
- Enabled 'Save data' button to save SED model when the display tab is at "Stellar SED"

## Version 0.3.0 (2026-01-26)

Updated instrument according to step1-revision

- Increased primary diameter from 30 to 35 cm
- NUV band pass shifted from 0.25-0.33um to 0.24-0.32um to capture additional Fe bands
- The `.csv` output from command-line call now includes the minimum fluxes and SNRs in band
- The `.csv` output from command-line call replaced mean fluxes and SNRs in band with the median
- Added quantum-efficiency throughputs as function of wavelength 
- Added PHOENIX and BT-Settl stellar SEDs
- Added option to upload custom stellar SEDs
- Noise and TSO resolution inputs now show the true resolution being used (data is binned down by # of pixels: 2, 3, 4, ...etc. So there's only a fixed number of resolutions possible, particularly at the highest resolutions).
- Updated JWST-programs catalog (there were some missing programs before)
